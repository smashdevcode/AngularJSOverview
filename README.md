# AngularJSOverview

## Getting Started

To preview the application, you'll need to setup a local web server. Run the
following npm command to install [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server),
a simple Node.js web server.

```
npm install http-server -g

```

This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.

Then to run the app, just run the following command:

```
http-server
```

Then browse to the following URL in your favorite browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```
